Basic Discrete Event Simulation Model of Dynamic Queue and Service

The model represents a single queue that holds n customers and has m service workers, able to process one customer at a time. The queue and service capacity can easily be changed in the settings to run different simulations and see which capacity that produces the best results. This model is meant to be used as a template or stating-point, as it does not meassure any type of performance (except lost customers).
